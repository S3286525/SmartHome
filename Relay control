# Running in realtime, can turn on/off light via relay control

# Import Raspberry Pi GPIO pin functionality
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

# Set up to use GPIO pin numbers instead of board pin numbers
GPIO.setmode(BCM)

# Setup GPIO pin to be used to turn relay on/off
pin = 16

# Assign the GPIO pin as the output
GPIO.setup(pin, OUT)

# "HIGH" will turn on relay, resulting in light on
GPIO.output(pin, HIGH)

# "LOW" will turn off relay, resulting in light off
GPIO.output(pin, LOW)
